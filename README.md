# playBot
Simple play bot for streaming services. Intended for Spotify but can be used for others. I will not add proxies to this if you wish to use it for other purposes.

✔️ By default, uses the Spotify web player to play songs repetitively, without the need of Spotify Premium.

✔️ Fails occasionally, haven't yet found a way to get around that but I will update this if found.

✔️ Written from scratch in C++. I am new to C++, please don't murder me.

If you encounter any issues, please post them in Issues and I will address them.

✔️ This was ran on a 1920x1080 monitor. Other resolutions may require tweaking of the code (including the "Don't change this" code).

✔️ Chrome is needed by default, but can be changed.

✔️ Tested on Spotify Premium. Must be logged in to Spotify on Chrome, Premium should not be a nescessity.

✔️ Open one blank chrome tab before running the software.

Enjoy.
